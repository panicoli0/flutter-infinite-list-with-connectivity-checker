# flutter-infinite-list-with-connectivity-checker
 BloC inifinite list with BloC connectivity checker.

The idea with this example is to add Connectivity-Checker BloC from https://burcus.medium.com/flutter-checking-continuously-internet-connection-using-bloc-updated-b89413a08dc0 

So our infinite-list app detects when there is internet connection or not so it displays a msg to the user and also keep loading post if the connection backs.
